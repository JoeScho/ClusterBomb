This is a mobile application created using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) aimed at helping people who suffer from [Cluster Headaches](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cluster-headaches/Pages/Introduction.aspx) to better track details of the attacks such as: 

* Frequency
* Duration
* Potential triggers
* Medications Used

This can then be used to display various graphs, and hopefully then estimate when an attack may occur so that the sufferer may be better prepared for it.
